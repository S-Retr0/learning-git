# How To Use Git  (macOS)

This is a simple guide I'm creating while I'm trying to learn Git since I'm new to it.
I'm just looking and adding content from different books, blogs and docs and trying to write something that will help me out to become familiar with Git.

### 0) What is Git?

Git a collection of command line utilities that track and record changes in file (most often source code, but you track anything you wish). With Git you can restore old version of your project, compare, analyse, merge changes and more. This process is referred to as VERSION CONTROL.

Git is decentralized, which means that it doesn't depend on a central server to keep old versions of your files. Instead it works fully locally by storing this data as a folder on your hard drive, which we call a REPOSITORY. However you can store a copy of your repository online, which makes it easy for multiple people to collaborate and work on the same code. This is what websites like "Github" and "BitBucket" are used for.
