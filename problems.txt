# Problems along the road #

Here I will document problems I encountered and mistakes I made and how I solved them (Well, If I managed to ahahha)


Px00	fatal: repository 'https://github.com/S-Retr0/learning-git.com/' not found

	The problem is that I typed learning-git.com instead of learning-git.git when I was trying to connect to the remote repo (git remote add)
	My bad, this means that I was trying to connect to a non existing page. To solve the problem I just removed the remote connection and added the righ one.

	$ git remote -v
	origin	https://github.com/S-Retr0/learning-git.com (fetch)
	origin	https://github.com/S-Retr0/learning-git.com (push)
	$ git remote rm origin
	$ git remote -v
	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/S-Retr0/learning-git.git
